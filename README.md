# Mug-Material-Classifier-Decision-Tree
This Python project implements a Decision Tree classifier to predict the type of a material based on four measurements: height, diameter, weight, and hue. The problem is a multiclass classification problem, where the objective is to correctly predict one of three potential material types.
